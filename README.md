# 🧮 BMI Calculator – Python to HTML with Gen AI

This project showcases the transformation of a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator written in Python into a fully functional web-based application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — with the help of Generative AI.

🔍 Overview
The original Python script accepts a user's weight and height (in feet), converts the height to meters, calculates the BMI, and classifies it into standard health categories (Normal, Overweight, Obese, etc.).

With generative AI assistance, this logic was adapted into a responsive and minimalist web interface that anyone can use online.
